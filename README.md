##Wildfire Impact Analysis & Forecasting – Power BI & Python

####📌 Project Overview
Wildfires cause significant financial losses, environmental destruction, and human casualties. This project provides a data-driven analysis of wildfire trends, identifying high-risk locations, and forecasting financial damages using Power BI and Python-based predictive modeling.

###🚀 Key Features
•	Historical Wildfire Impact Analysis – Evaluated 100+ wildfire incidents, financial losses of $239.61K, and nearly 3 million acres burned.
•	Python-Integrated Predictive Modeling – Implemented ARIMA, ETS, Linear Regression, and XGBoost models to project financial losses.
•	Advanced Data Visualization – Developed interactive maps, trend analysis, and heatmaps to display financial risks.
•	Actionable Insights for Decision-Makers – Identified high-risk wildfire zones and uncovered the leading cause (38% of wildfires result from human activity).

###🔧 Tools & Technologies Used
•	Power BI – Data visualization, trend analysis, and interactive dashboards.
•	Python (Integrated in Power BI) – Forecasting wildfire losses using time-series models.
•	ARIMA, ETS, Linear Regression, XGBoost – Used for financial risk prediction.
•	Matplotlib & Seaborn – Python-based data visualization.
•	Pandas & NumPy – Data processing and manipulation.
