## Wildfire Impact Analysis & Forecasting – Power BI & Python

#### 📌 Project Overview
Wildfires cause significant financial losses, environmental destruction, and human casualties. This project provides a data-driven analysis of wildfire trends, identifying high-risk locations, and forecasting financial damages using Power BI and Python-based predictive modeling.

### 🚀 Key Features
- Historical Wildfire Impact Analysis – Evaluated 100+ wildfire incidents, financial losses of $239.61K, and nearly 3 million acres burned.
-	Python-Integrated Predictive Modeling – Implemented ARIMA, ETS, Linear Regression, and XGBoost models to project financial losses.
-	Advanced Data Visualization – Developed interactive maps, trend analysis, and heatmaps to display financial risks.
-	Actionable Insights for Decision-Makers – Identified high-risk wildfire zones and uncovered the leading cause (38% of wildfires result from human activity).

### 🔧 Tools & Technologies Used
-	Power BI – Data visualization, trend analysis, and interactive dashboards.
-	Python (Integrated in Power BI) – Forecasting wildfire losses using time-series models.
-	ARIMA, ETS, Linear Regression, XGBoost – Used for financial risk prediction.
-	Matplotlib & Seaborn – Python-based data visualization.
-	Pandas & NumPy – Data processing and manipulation.
